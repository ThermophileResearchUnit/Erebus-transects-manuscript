# Erebus-transects-manuscript
Environmental and biological data (phyloseq object) and associated code for analyzing the data for the 2021 Erebus transects manuscript. All files were created and/or edited by Mafalda Baptista, Emily Smith, and Stephen Noell.

To explore abundance profiles for whichever ASVs you want to look at, see the code at the end of the "Biological data initial analysis_SN.Rmd" file.

R files:

Analysis of microbial community_SN: code for creating Figure 4 in the paper.

Biological data initial analysis_SN: code for initial analysis and visualization of biological data, producing Sup. Fig 3 and Sup. Fig 2C

Env and bio data_SN: code for analyzing correlations between biological and environmental data, producing Fig. 2E and 3E

Environmental data_SN: code for analyzing environmental data, producing Fig. 2A-D, Fig. 3A-D, and Sup. Fig 2A-B

Erebus_random_forest_SN: code for Random Forest analysis, producing Figure 5
